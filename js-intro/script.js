// and handle user interactions in real-time without the need for page reloads.
// In recent years, JavaScript has also gained popularity as a server-side language 
// with the introduction of platforms such as Node.js.
// With Node.js, JavaScript can be used to build scalable and high-performance 
// server-side applications, enabling developers to write both the client-side and
//  server-side components of a web application using a single language.
// JavaScript's versatility across client-side and server-side environments makes 
// it a powerful language for full-stack web development.
